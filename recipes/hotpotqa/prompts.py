### Recent tool / format issues

### Instructions
Analyze the **Retrieved Passages** and **History Actions** to determine the next set of actions.
Enclose your analysis of the state and decision logic within `<analysis>...</analysis>` tags.
**You support parallel tool calling.**
You should output multiple tool calls in a single step if several independent actions are valuable at the current state.
**Attend to the history actions and avoid repeating the same search queries.**
When you can answer the question from the current passages, put the short final answer inside `<answer></answer>`
tags (no explanation) instead of further tool calls.
