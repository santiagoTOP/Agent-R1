# Agent-R1

## Training Powerful LLM Agents with End-to-End Reinforcement Learning

Agent-R1 is an open-source framework for training powerful language agents with end-to-end reinforcement learning. With Agent-R1, you can build custom agent workflows, define interactive environments and tools, and train multi-step agents in a unified RL pipeline.

-   :material-brain:{ .lg .middle } **Step-level MDP**

    ---

    A principled MDP formulation that enables flexible context management and per-step reward signals.

-   :material-layers-outline:{ .lg .middle } **Layered Abstractions**

    ---

    From maximum flexibility to out-of-the-box, choose the right level of abstraction for your use case.

## Reading Guide

- Start with [`Getting Started`](getting-started/index.md) if you want the minimal path: use the same environment as `verl`, download the processed data from [ModelScope](https://www.modelscope.cn/datasets/Melmaphother/Agent-R1-data), run a sanity check, and confirm the repository is ready.
- Read [`Step-level MDP`](core-concepts/step-level-mdp.md) and [`Layered Abstractions`](core-concepts/layered-abstractions.md) if you want to understand the framework design before touching code.
- Follow [`Agent Task Tutorial`](tutorials/agent-task.md) if you want to see the minimal GSM8K + Tool example through `ToolEnv + BaseTool`.
- Read [`Recipes and Algorithms`](tutorials/recipes-and-algorithms.md) for the current GSM8K, HotpotQA, ALFWorld, WebShop, paper-search, and algorithm script layout.

## Scope of This Documentation

This version of the documentation is intentionally compact. It focuses on the parts that are already central to Agent-R1 today: the core agent abstractions, runnable examples, and recipe-level integrations.
